# incentiveUK_landing_page
This is a simple business landing page made with html/css, this was my first actual project to be deployed

This is a static page made for my very first client, a UK based company who wanted a very simple landing page.

Their main purpose of this website was to have a contact form and a light web presence, with the option of modifying this in the future.

I made this simple version just using html/css and for the contact form and email functionality I used formspree.io for fast and easy authenticated email forwarding service.

At the same time, I created the same app in a React component saved on my local device for future refernce incase the client needs any upgrading.
